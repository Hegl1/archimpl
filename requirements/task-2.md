# Task 2

- **Submission Due**: 2022-03-21

## Description

You have to prepare a presentation and slides covering the record format of SQLite. Your presentation should have a duration of ten minutes.

Use the SQLite [Record Format Documentation](https://sqlite.org/fileformat.html#record_format) as a starting point. Try to understand how the layout of a record in SQLite looks like. You will have to at least follow the link to the documentation for the `varint` type and understand how it works to understand the record format. In your presentation, you should answer at least the following questions:

- What is the layout of a record in SQLite?
- How are the record header and its fields encoded in SQLite?
- How does SQLite represent NULL values?
- How would fields of the three data types that you have to implement for your project (which we called `int`, `float` and `varchar`) be stored in an SQLite table?

For your presentation, only consider records belonging to tables. Index records will be discussed in later lectures.

## Submission

- Publish your slides (PDF-Format) supporting your ten minutes presentation in your repository.

## Grading

For this task you can earn up to four points, where zero means "nothing submitted" and four means "excellent".
