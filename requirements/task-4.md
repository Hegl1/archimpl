# Task 4

- **Submission Due**: 2021-04-25

## Description

You have to prepare a presentation and slides explaining the `EXPLAIN` (or equivalent functionality) of a real DBMS. Your presentation should have a duration of ten minutes.

Each team will be assigned to one of the following DBMS:

- Team 1: SQLite (`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`)
- Team 3: PostgreSQL (`EXPLAIN`)
- Team 5: MS SQL Server (`SET SHOWPLAN_TEXT ON` before you execute the query)
- Team 4: MySQL 8.0+ (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`)
- Team 2: Oracle (`EXPLAIN PLAN FOR`)

To run the system you can either install it on your machine or use a container (e.g., docker or podman). Oracle is available online in form of their Live SQL platform.

Cover the following things in your presentation:

- What plan operators are available? Try to identify the operators equivalent to the ones we covered in the lecture.
- How does the `EXPLAIN` output of the DBMS look like?
- How do you read and interpret it?

## Submission

- Publish your slides (PDF-Format) supporting your ten minutes presentation in your repository.

## Grading

For this task you can earn up to four points, where zero means "nothing submitted" and four means "excellent".
