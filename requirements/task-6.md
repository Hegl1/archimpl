# Task 6

- **Submission Due**: 2022-05-16

## Description

You have to prepare a presentation and slides covering how real DBMS execute recursive queries. Your presentation should have a duration of ten minutes.

Cover the following things:

- The syntax of a recursive query (very brief).
- How the execution plan looks like (e.g. output of the explain + explanation).
- How the execution works. Focus on the implementation of the operators used in the execution plan and the control flow during execution.

For your presentation, focus on the implementation details and execution rather than the SQL syntax details.

Each team has to choose one DBMS from the following list:

- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- MS SQL Server
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Oracle
- IBM DB2

Multiple teams can choose the same DBMS. If you are having trouble understanding how the execution works in the system of your choice, please choose a different one. You may encounter plan operators that you are unfamilier with during the work on this task. Read up on them either via the documentation of your chosen database system or via the system's code (if available).

## Submission

- Publish your slides (PDF-Format) supporting your ten minutes presentation in your repository.

## Grading

For this task you can earn up to four points, where zero means "nothing submitted" and four means "excellent".
