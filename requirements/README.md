# Requirements

This folder contains requirements that are necessary to be solved. In general there are two types of requirements:

- Tasks
- Milestones

Tasks are requirements that need to be fulfilled for the inverted classroom sessions and milestones need to be fulfilled by your implementation. In general they are due until the end of the stated day which is the day before we discuss them in the course.

The list of tasks and milestones below will be updated regularly:

- [Task 1](task-1.md)
